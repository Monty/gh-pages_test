## What's Streaming Today?

**Acorn TV** and **BritBox** are streaming services carrying over 300 
British, Australian, New Zealand and other television shows each.
**MHz Choice** is a streaming service for over 200 subtitled
European television detective, mystery, and crime shows.  All are
available in the US on Apple TV, Amazon Prime, Xfinity, the web, and
[many others](https://support.mhznetworks.com/support/solutions/folders/44001123070).

**[Acorn](https://acorn.tv/browse)**, 
**[BritBox](https://www.britbox.com/us/programmes)** and
**[MHz](https://watch.mhzchoice.com/browse)** all
have visual interfaces which list all their shows. However,
you have to click on the image for each series to see its description.
I can't find any web page or document that describes all the available
series in one place.

I wrote these scripts to fetch the descriptions and other info from
their websites and create .csv spreadsheet files containing these
columns: (*Titles are hyperlinks to the series on the web*)

+ **Acorn TV:** Title | Seasons | Episodes | Duration | Description 
+ **Britbox:** Title | Seasons | Episodes | Duration | Genre | Year | Rating | Description
+ **MHz:** Title | Seasons | Episodes | Duration | Genre | Country | Language | Rating | Description

I know of no way to incorporate formatting such as column width,
horizontal centering, etc. into a .csv file. However, 
[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview)
enables you to automate formatting spreadsheets uploaded to [Google
Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/).

The scripts also produce spreadsheets and text files containing cast members,
characters portrayed, alternate titles, and other details from the streaming services
and **IMDb**. The first line of those spreadsheets contain descriptive column headers.
